# Fondation Sarah Grond

The Fondation Sarah Grondâ€™s mission is to financially help and provide advice to families in need, either directly or indirectly in Luxembourg, the UK or abroad. The main purpose is to help children that have lost one or both parents.
The Fondation Sarah Grond is a real established organisation , 
The purpose of choosing this project is to help grow my knowledge of HTML , CSS and bootstrap wireframes. So I would like to redesign the existing website and make it stand out more and bring new functionality to the website.

## UX

### User Experience 
#### User stories
As a First time I would like to know that I am in the right place by seeing the name of the organisation and what its intention is 

As a first time user I would like to see clear navigation buttons as to where I can find Information or contact the organisation and what else they may have to offer.  

As a first time user Information about the organisation . Why it was started and what its future plans are.  

### Design 
The colour scheme will go with the colours of the logo so the colour plate will be 
<img src="images/FSG colour.png" width="800"/>
The typography for the project was created through google fonts , font is Roboto Condensed italic 
Imagery for clear indication of where different pages can be accessed with larger buttons for our older visitors  
 
I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible but also wanted each page to display individual information.

### Wireframing my project on was prepared on balsamiq and figma

## Technologies Used
#### HTML5 

The language used to create the form is the base for the website.

#### CSS3

The language used to style the HTML5 elements according to the design colour scheme.

#### Bootstrap framework(https://getbootstrap.com/)
 I used Bootstrap's grid container system as I wanted my project to be responsive through mobile first design and there is no need to reinvent the wheel 

#### Balsamic (https://balsamiq.com/)
Balsamiq helped me get a rough a idea of how I wanted the website to be set out simple quick sketch of the layout  

#### FontAwesome(https://fontawesome.com/)
I used the five free FontAwesome icons in my design.

#### Shutterstock
This was the source of some of the images in my project.

#### TinyPNG
I used to compress my images to reduce loading time to reduce the loading on each page.

### Testing 
#### W3C Markup Validation Service
 This was a great tool throughout the project to test my HTML and CSS code.

#### W3Schools
 I've referred to WSC Schools several times whilst building 

#### Problems and issues Found
check all buttons on each page to see if they worked correctly. The logo meant to redirect to the home page was not working and it was because the links were not added to the navbar correctly on each page.
Testing the how responsive each page will be 
            I used google devops to see that the responsive design images were the biggest
            problems because they didn't reduce in size when I tried to change to iphone 6/7/8 and 
            would stay the same on the cards used to apply to different sections.

#### Testing on different devices through deployment

The iPad's response was the same as the desktop 
Iphone response the images were larger and caused an overflow outside screen size.
Samsung A20e response was the same as iPhone testing overflow of the screen size.

this was a css issue that needed to be addressed because images were added to html and I needed to add @media response to css 
which I didn't have for each type of webpage explorer.

text and button links were issued because I didn't add the appropriate links to each html page,and not each page could be redirected to the homepage and that was because of the bootstraps carousel which I decided not to use and used a jumbotron instead.

### Deployment
#### Deploying my project
 I created my project on GitHub and used GitPod's development environment to write my code.To make my project viewable to others, I deployed my project to GitHub Pages with the following process:

1.I opened the 'Settings' section of my project repository in GitHub.

2.From there, I scrolled to the 'GitHub Pages' section.

3.Here I selected 'assets branch' as my Source.

4.This deployed my project on GitHub Pages and allowed me to share the live website with others.

More information about this process can be found on the following link: Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site
